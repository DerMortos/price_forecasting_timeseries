# ðŸ“ˆ Market Price Forecasting using EWMA

This project explores time series forecasting techniques to analyze historical market price trends using Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA). The data is based on crowdsourced transaction records collected by political science researcher Zachary M. Jones. The goal is to study how regional prices shift over time, potentially in response to policy decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Using a simple yet effective linear forecast model built on EWMA smoothing, this analysis includes:

- Daily price changes and volatility metrics
- EWMA of daily differences to establish a trend (slope)
- Linear forecasts extending one year into the future
- Confidence intervals to represent uncertainty over time

The project avoids external dependencies by using standard Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `statsmodels`.

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**
   Data was cleaned and filtered to focus on a 4-year period (2010â€“2014).

2. **Trend Estimation**
   - The EWMA of the time series was used to estimate the **intercept**.
   - The EWMA of the daily price difference was used to estimate the **slope**.

3. **Forecasting**
   The model predicts prices using a linear formula:
   `forecast = intercept + slope * Î”t`
